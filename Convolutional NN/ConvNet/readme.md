This is the first basic project I worked on.

I created a simple convolutional neural network to predict objects in the Cifar10 dataset.

The model gave a validation accuracy of 0.7447 after an early stopping at 44th epoch

The model can be further improved, such as tuning hyperparameters , changing the number of layers or neurons. 

I preferred going deeper into convolutional neural networks architectures.

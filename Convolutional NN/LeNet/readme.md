This project utilizes the LeNet architecture for digit recognition, which was originally proposed by Yann LeCun, Leon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner in their paper titled "Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition" published in 1998.

The LeNet architecture has been widely recognized for its contributions to the field of deep learning and image recognition tasks.

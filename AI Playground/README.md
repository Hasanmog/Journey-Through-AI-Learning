# AI-playground

## Overview
The `AI-playground` folder is a collection of experimental scripts and Jupyter notebooks where various machine learning and deep learning algorithms are implemented and tested. This space serves as a creative sandbox for trying out new ideas, testing hypotheses, and learning through trial and error. The performance of these algorithms may vary, and the focus is on exploration and learning rather than optimization and production-readiness.


This work was my first look into AI/ML. In other words , I'm was playing with ML :)

One more thing ,  most probably they're not optimal :p

## Note 
I may have used different resources for help such as blogs , youtube videos , chatgpt , ...
